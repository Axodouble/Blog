# Australia
#### This is an active blog post where I will be writing my activites since I have moved to Australia.

## Thu Jun 19 2025
The week passed by so quickly. I have spent time studying some new things I wish to understand better, I have also realized that I once again overengineered something that could've been a lot simpler.

I mean this entire blog here only came about because I was curious how easy it would be for me to translate markdown into HTML, and now here we are, this entire blog is written in Markdown because I was too lazy to need to go back and format something when I could just format it as I go.

At least its open source so anyone can take a look right?
First time for me to also use multiple docker stages in this way, I thought it worked pretty neatly.
My disdain for bloated overengineered Javascript frameworks has got me pulling this stuff myself now, but at least it serves everything statically and compiles it at launch, so that is, better? Questionably so at least.

## Early Beginnings (Wed Jun 18 2025)
I have recently moved to Australia, and moved in with my lovely Girlfriend.
I have spent the past few days organizing myself, learning some new things and just getting comfortable, largely thanks to the help of those around me.

I was lucky to celebrate my Girlfriends 21st birthday with her and her family.

I have been busy trying to up my portofolio at least a little bit to aid me in my job search, as I obviously want to earn an income.

I will be updating my writing here once every bit, for now this will be it.
