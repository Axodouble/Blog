# Australia
#### This is an active blog post where I will be writing my activites since I have moved to Australia.

## Early Beginnings (Wed Jun 18 2025)
I have recently moved to Australia, and moved in with my lovely Girlfriend.
I have spent the past few days organizing myself, learning some new things and just getting comfortable, largely thanks to the help of those around me.

I was lucky to celebrate my Girlfriends 21st birthday with her and her family.

I have been busy trying to up my portofolio at least a little bit to aid me in my job search, as I obviously want to earn an income.

I will be updating my writing here once every bit, for now this will be it.
