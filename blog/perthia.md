As I recently moved to Perth, Australia, I noticed that there was a severe lack of gaming servers that are located in Australia, let alone Perth.

Now that is due to Perth being a comparatively small city (est 2.38 million 2024).
However I won't let that stop me, because I don't feel like being stopped.

So I have started a new project, that being [Perthia](https://perthia.com), I am not sure how long I will work on this as some projects I fail quickly on purpose.
But I do know that I would enjoy being able to play games on game servers with less than 300ms latency at least.

So that is what I will be working on the next few months, and I will be setting up some game servers, at least for myself but also for people around me who are interested in joining.
