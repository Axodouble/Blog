## A job, work & life (Wed Dec 3 2025)

Having found a job as a Dev-Ops engineer a bit ago, a lot of my free time has been put into learning; studying network architecture, networking in general, development practices and system administration.

For a long time I believed that I would feel most challenged as a Software Developer, however I have come to the light of Dev-Ops.
Being able to apply my knowledge and skills to infrastructure and building systems while coding the necessities is something I never realized I would enjoy as much as I do.

Having spent years working on self-hosting my own infrastructure prepared me for a lot of my daily work, so a lot of it was already fairly familiar to me.
Being able to work with Senior Dev-Ops engineers has taught me a lot of invaluable information, and also given me a ton of new insights that is hard to put a price tag on.

As for my personal life, things have been going lovely, I celebrated my 21st a few months back and thoroughly enjoyed it, though I miss my family back home, I am excited to work on my future here.
Being able to do all of this with my Girlfriend has been absolutely lovely, and it is something I could never wish to be better.

But that will be potentially my last entry for this year.

## Early Beginnings (Wed Jun 18 2025)

I have recently moved to Australia, and moved in with my lovely Girlfriend.
I have spent the past few days organizing myself, learning some new things and just getting comfortable, largely thanks to the help of those around me.

I was lucky to celebrate my Girlfriends 21st birthday with her and her family.

I have been busy trying to up my portofolio at least a little bit to aid me in my job search, as I obviously want to earn an income.

I will be updating my writing here once every bit, for now this will be it.
